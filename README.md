# The End of All Evil (2006)
#### Written by Jeremy Locke

"Never in all of history have the elements been arrayed against the evil manifest in tyranny and slavery as they are today. The dreams that burn in the hearts of billions have been growing stronger through the millennia. The children of this world are owed a liberty from slavery that few are able to comprehend. This is the most exciting era in all of human history; it is the dawn of the freedom of mankind."

This book teaches just one lesson: You have infinite worth.
